```{r}
metadata <- read.table(file="wild.metadata.txt", header=T)
rownames(metadata) <- metadata$Group
metadata <- metadata[,-1]
```

Question 1

Part 1) How many samples were described in wild.metadata.txt?

There is one sample per row, so if I find the number of rows in the table, I know 
the number of samples. Here I am considering different samples from the same mouse
to be separate.
```{r, eval=TRUE}
num_rows <- nrow(metadata)
num_rows
```

There are `r nrow(metadata)` samples in this table.

Part 2) How many columns are in the table? What are their names?

```{r, eval=TRUE}
num_col <- ncol(metadata)
num_col
#names of the columns
colnames(metadata)
```

The number of columns is `r ncol(metadata)` and the column names are 
`r colnames(metadata)`

Part 3) How many mice weighed 15 or more grams?

I can find this by deleting replicate entries in the table, then subsetting the table
by weights to only include the mice that weigh more than 15 g.

```{r, eval=TRUE}
# I remove duplicates based on the their ear tag number
mouse.unique.mat <- metadata[!duplicated(metadata["ET"]),]
# then remove all mice with weights less than 15 g
weightGreater15 <- mouse.unique.mat[mouse.unique.mat["Weight"]>15,]
# then count the remaining rows
nrow(mouse.unique.mat)
```

There are `r nrow(mouse.unique.mat)` mice with at least one recorded weight greater than 15 g.

Part 4) What is the median weight for the mice sampled?

```{r, eval=TRUE}
median.weight <- median(metadata[,8])
```

The median weight is `r median.weight`. Note - I first tried this with the command 
median(metadata["Weight"]), which returned an error message, indicating that the input file
subset by column name is not a numeric object. When extracted the weight values using the 
column number, R recognized them as a vector.

Part 5) How many PMG mice were there?

```{r, eval=TRUE}
# first find the mouse records that have species "PMG" and subset the matrix
mouse.PMG <- metadata[metadata["SP"]=="PMG",]

# then remove duplicates

PMG.unique.mat <- mouse.PMG[!duplicated(mouse.PMG["ET"]),]
```

There are `r nrow(mouse.PMG)` separate records of PMG mice, and `r nrow(PMG.unique.mat)` unique
PMG mice.

Part 6) How many female PL mice were there?

```{r, eval=TRUE}
# first I find the number of "PL" mice
mouse.PL <- metadata[metadata["SP"]=="PL",]

# then I find the number of those that are female

mouse.fem.PL <- mouse.PL[mouse.PL["Sex"]=="F",]

# remove duplicates

mouse.fem.PL.unique <- mouse.fem.PL[!duplicated(mouse.fem.PL["ET"]),]
```

There are `r nrow(mouse.fem.PL)` separate records of female PL mice, and 
`r nrow(mouse.fem.PL.unique)` individual female PL mice.

Part 7) Alphabetize `wild.metadata.txt` by the ear tag number (only show the first 5 rows of the table)

```{r, eval=TRUE}
sorted <- metadata[order(metadata["ET"]),]
```

The first 5 rows of `metadata` sorted on ear tag number are: 

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
sorted[1:5,]
```

Part 8) Sort the table by the weight of each animal

```{r, eval=TRUE}
weight <- metadata[order(metadata["Weight"]),]
```

The table sorted by weight is:

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
weight
```

Part 9) The `Station` column indicates where the mice were sampled. Where were the most mice captured?

```{r, eval=TRUE}
best.station <- sort(table(metadata["Station"]), decreasing=TRUE)[1]
```

The station where the most mice were sampled was `r names(best.station)`.

Part 10) How many mice were captured there?

```{r, eval=TRUE}
N20mice <- metadata[metadata["Station"]=="N20",]

N20.unique <- N20mice[!duplicated(N20mice["ET"]),]
```

There were `r nrow(N20mice)` captures of `r nrow(N20.unique)` unique individuals at 
station `r names(best.station)`.


Question 2

This code gives us a sequence of numbers begining at 1 and going to 100, increasing by 3 at each step
```{r, eval=TRUE}
seq(1,100,3)
```

This code repeats the letters a and b ten times.
```{r, eval=TRUE}
rep(c("a","b"),10)
```

This code generates 10 numbers drawn from a uniform distribution between 0 and 1. For each element of the vector r, the "order" code gives that element's place in a ranked vector that places the elements of r in order from lowest to highest.

```{r, eval=TRUE}
r <- runif(10)
rr <- order(r)
```

To get the final output vector `r r[rr]`, you subset the vector r by the vector rr, using the code

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
r[rr]
```

As far as I can tell, the % sign is not an operator on its own in R. The %% is the modulus operator, which gives the remainder when the first number is divided by the second.

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
100 %% 3
```

This operator subsets the table metadata such that it only shows the individuals that are both of the species PMG and weigh 16 g. For this case, the && operator returns an error, while the & operator returns the (presumable) table of interest.

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
metadata[metadata$Weight==16 & metadata$SP=="PMG",]
```

Question 3.  Calculate the mode for the weight of the mice in `wild.metadata.txt`

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
mode.weight <- sort(table(metadata["Weight"]), decreasing=TRUE)[1]
```

The mode weight is `r names(mode.weight)` g.

4.  Using R commands, write the table to a new text file, but exclude the `Ear` and `Repro` columns.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
metadata <- metadata[,c(-7, -9)]
write.table(metadata, file = "~/Desktop/metadata.txt")
```

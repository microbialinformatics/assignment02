For your assignments, I would like you to integrate your answers with text while showing me the code that you used to generate the solution. So for example, if the question was, "How many mice were captured on 5_25?", I would expect to see something like...

```{r}
metadata <- read.table(file="wild.metadata.txt", header=T)
rownames(metadata) <- metadata$Group
metadata <- metadata[,-1]

on.date <- metadata$Date == "5_25"
n.captured <- nrow(metadata[on.date,])
```

There were `r n.captured` mice captured on 5_25.

This would be rendered as:

There were 2 mice captured on 5_25.
